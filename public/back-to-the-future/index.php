    <p>There is a lot of javascript development in the software world today. I have spent quite some time programming in
        javascript. I'm not a web developer. Umm, can't you tell? I want a web presence and having a dedicated web site
        is a no brainer in 2023. I chose to run my own server and use some php this time around.ðŸ˜ˆ</p>
